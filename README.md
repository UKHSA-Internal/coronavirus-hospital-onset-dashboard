This dashboard shows patient location when they first tested positive for COVID-19 (PCR test). Location relates to the hospital they attended in A&E or inpatient admission.

## Build

If you want to build this locally, you'll need to download and install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop)

Once you clone this repo, run `renv::restore()` on your first instance in RStudio to load up the managed package list.
