## Definitions of hospital-onset COVID-19

### Community-onset

If a patient has a first positive test within 2 days of being admitted, the infection is counted as ‘community-onset’ (CO). This is because the patient almost certainly became infected before being admitted to hospital.

### Hospital-onset, indeterminate healthcare-associated

If a patient has a first positive test 3 to 7 days after being admitted, the infection is counted as ‘hospital-onset, indeterminate healthcare-associated’ (HO.iHA). This is because we cannot be sure whether the infection occurred before or after the patient was admitted.

### Hospital-onset, probable healthcare-associated

If a patient has a first positive test 8 to 14 days after being admitted, the infection is counted as ‘hospital-onset, probable healthcare-associated’ (HO.pHA). This is because the patient probably became infected while in hospital, but we cannot exclude the possibility that they were infected before being admitted to hospital.

### Hospital-onset, definite healthcare-associated

If a patient has a first positive test 15 or more days after being admitted to hospital, the infection is counted as ‘hospital-onset, definite healthcare-associated’ (HO.HA). This is because the patient almost certainly became infected while in hospital. The source of infection may have been another patient, healthcare worker, visitor or other person with whom the patient had contact after being admitted to hospital.

### No hospital record

Patients who do not have a record of hospital admission are counted as ‘no hospital record’ (NHR).


## Data sources

Public Health England (PHE) collects data on all SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) tests performed in NHS laboratories across England. Laboratory data systems provide an automatic daily feed of test results into PHE’s Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).

The NHS collects data on all hospital attendances and admissions. These data are collated by NHS Digital and sent daily to PHE via the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) and Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS) data collections. SUS records admitted patient stays, ECDS records Accident and Emergency (A&E) attendances.

### Data changes

Because of variation in reporting on a hospital level, data is subject to change, particularly in the most recent 6 weeks. This may result in changes to:

+ the provider associated with the case
+ the hospital-onset infection category


## Data preparation and linkage

Where a patient has multiple COVID-19 positive tests, the first positive test is retained.

Hospital records from SUS and ECDS are linked to SGSS using combinations of NHS number, hospital number and date of birth. The first positive COVID-19 test result is compared to the admission date from the hospital record.

Where a patient has had multiple hospital admissions, priority is given to:

1. tests taken during a hospital stay
2. hospital inpatient stays over A&E attendances

Where a test is taken between 2 distinct hospital admissions, the stay before the positive test result is used.

Patients counted as 'no hospital record' in the most recent data may subsequently be counted as 'community-onset' or 'hospital-onset' as records become available.
