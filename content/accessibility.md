+ listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

### Technical information about this website’s accessibility

Public Health England is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

### Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

#### Contrast and use of colour

Some elements of the graph on the [Dashboard page](#!/) are indicated just by colour. The information is also displayed as text on hover, but this cannot be accessed by keyboard users.

Some elements of the [Dashboard page](#!/) lack contrast with the background, for example:

+ on the graph keys, when the user selects them to remove the data from the graph.  The graphs are created by a third party (Plotly), so unfortunately we cannot fix this.
+ on the camera icon, when the graph is hovered over. The graphs are created by a third party, so unfortunately we cannot fix this.

#### Keyboard accessibility

Some parts of the website are not accessible when navigating by keyboard only. On the [Dashboard page](#!/), keyboard users cannot tab to elements of the graph, so cannot view the statistics that can be seen when hovering over parts of the graph. The graphs are created by a third party, so unfortunately we cannot fix this. The data can be accessed in an alternative format, in the data table.

#### Screen reader accessibility

Some parts of the website are not accessible using a screen reader. When swiping through the [Dashboard page](#!/), iOS Voiceover users cannot access the graph screenshot option. The graphs are created by a third party, so unfortunately we cannot fix this.

#### Time limits

There is a timeout on all pages. People are prompted to reload the page when this happens. There is no option to extend the timer.

We cannot fix this, but please be aware that the website has a 10-minute idle limit, which cannot be changed.

#### Navigation

There is no option for keyboard users to skip to the main content, to bypass features like the header and navigation menu. As there are few focusable features before the main content, this should be a minor problem.

#### Source code and markup accessibility

On the [Dashboard page](#!/), the message that is displayed when selecting a category is not announced to NVDA screen reader users. The graphs are created by a third party, so unfortunately we cannot fix this.
